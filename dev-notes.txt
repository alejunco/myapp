Generate a GitHub access token by going to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. The access token should have the repo scope/permission. Once you have the token, assign it to an environment variable
    On macOS/linux:
        export GH_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>"
    On Windows, run in powershell:
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GH_TOKEN","<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>","User")
GH_TOKEN for this example: "6c9fe3b73c93eb0335ac605a88e1a854b3ee5bcc"

Make sure to restart IDE/Terminal to inherit latest env variable.

If you want to publish for more platforms, edit the publish script in package.json. For instance, to build for Windows and macOS:
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "publish": "build --mac --win -p always"
    },
    ...
